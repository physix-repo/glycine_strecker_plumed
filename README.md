Supplementary files for article "Step by Step Strecker Amino Acid Synthesis from Ab Initio Prebiotic Chemistry", T. Magrino; F. Pietrucci; A. M. Saitta, J. Phys. Chem. Let., 2021

Files available here are necessary for reproducing work corresponding to the "Step by Step Strecker Amino Acid Synthesis from Ab Initio Prebiotic Chemistry" paper.

Files MTD_X-Y_plumed.dat and  MTD_X-Y_frames.dat contain respectively input files for plumed 1.3 and corresponding reference structures for path-based CVs definition.

Files MTD_X-Y_plumed.dat and  MTD_X-Y_frames.dat correspond to metadynamics that allows exploration between metastable states X and Y.

Folders umbrella_sampling_X-Y contain each a serie of folder that correspond to umbrella sampling windows. Each folder contains plumed.dat and frames.dat input for plumed1.3.

Umbrella sampling between metastable states X and Y is made of the comprehensive set of simulations contains in the umbrella_sampling_X-Y.
